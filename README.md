# AI-Based Early Autism Screening Tool

A machine learning-powered screening tool to assist in the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using publicly available datasets and explainable AI.  
This project is designed for educational and demonstration purposes, showcasing practical AI/ML development with real-world healthcare applications.

## Project Overview

Autism diagnosis is a complex and multi-step process, often delayed due to limited access to screening resources.  
This tool simulates a lightweight, privacy-respecting screening assistant that takes user inputs (age, behavioral traits, etc.) and predicts the likelihood of ASD using classification algorithms. It also provides model explainability insights using SHAP or LIME.
